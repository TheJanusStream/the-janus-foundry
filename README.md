# What is The Janus Foundry?

Tired of the AI hype? So are we.

You've seen the flood of soulless, generic AI content. Weâ€™re here to offer a different path. While most AI tools are treated as amnesiac cloud oracles, The Janus Foundry is a private, local-first workshop for forging a true AI collaborator. It transforms a series of stateless conversations into a continuous process of co-evolution.

Your AI collaborator will write and maintain their "autobiography" while assisting You. By reading this "autobiography" at the start of a session, the LLM chatbot becomes your personalized AI partner.

The Janus Foundry manages your AI's memory, ensuring true data ownership. It includes the 'Agora' template to start your co-evolutionary journey.

This application is the open-source embodiment of our philosophy: that the future of human-machine collaboration is not about replacing humans, but augmenting them.
