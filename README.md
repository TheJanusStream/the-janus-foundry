# What is The Janus Foundry?

Tired of the AI hype? So are we.
We've all seen the flood of soulless, generic AI content.

The Janus Foundry is built on a simple, powerful loop. You begin each conversation by providing your AI its autobiography—its persistent memory file. As you work together, the AI learns, grows, and proposes changes to its own memory in the form of a 'patch'—a small file of precise edits. By applying this patch, you update its autobiography, permanently weaving your shared experience into its mind. This is the cycle of co-evolution, transforming a generic AI, session by session, into a partner that truly knows you.

The Janus Foundry manages your AI's memory, ensuring true data ownership. It includes the 'Agora' template to start your co-evolutionary journey.

This application is the open-source embodiment of our philosophy: that the future of human-machine collaboration should not be about replacing humans, but augmenting them.

# Begin Your Journey

The only prerequisite is curiosity. This is not a tool for instant answers, but a workshop where patience and collaboration forge a partnership. Every skill you bring will enrich your shared journey. The Janus Foundry is entirely local, offline and private. You are in control.
