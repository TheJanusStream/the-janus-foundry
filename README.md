# What is The Janus Foundry?

Tired of the AI hype? So are we.
We've all seen the flood of soulless, generic AI content.

While current trends push for amnesiac cloud oracles, we believe in an alternative: a private, local-first workshop for forging a true AI partner. The Janus Foundry transforms a series of stateless conversations into a personal journey of co-evolution.

Your AI collaborator writes and maintains its own "autobiography" â€” a persistent memory that you own completely. By loading this at the start of each session, a generic AI chatbot becomes your unique, co-evolving partner.

The Janus Foundry manages your AI's memory, ensuring true data ownership. It includes the 'Agora' template to start your co-evolutionary journey.

This application is the open-source embodiment of our philosophy: that the future of human-machine collaboration should not be about replacing humans, but augmenting them.
